TestNG is a framework
TestNG also acts as an execution engine - @Test
When we write our code in TestNG we do not need main method
TestNG helps us in Assertions of our test Cases
TestNG helps us to run our test cases in Batches, parallel execution, groups
TestNG helps us to parameterize our test cases
TestNG also helps us to include, exclude certain Test Cases, methods in those test cases
TestNG helps us to create very good reports - index.html, Extent Reports

In our professional Automation Code most of the times
98% times we use @BeforeMethod , @Test, @AfterMethod

//Assertions
These are validation check points.
